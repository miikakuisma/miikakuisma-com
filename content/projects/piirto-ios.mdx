Piirto app is super simple drawing app based on Apple's PencilKit. When cute robot character is pressed it will send your drawing to Open AI's Vision API for analysis, then from the analysis it will generate new image and adds it into your generated AI images.

Robot character image was created with Apple's Image Playground, then animated using Kling AI. The idea was to test if character animation could be used as status indicator during AI task processing.
