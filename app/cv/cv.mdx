# Miika Kuisma
## Senior Front-End Developer & UI Designer

### Intro

Having grown up with computers, I've been working with the web since 1997. I love creating new products from the ground up, from design to code.

I'm always coming up with new ideas and enjoy testing and prototyping them. Essentially, I aim to acquire a set of skills that enables me to bring all my imagined projects to life. In an increasingly digital world, I find myself venturing into new business fields to experiment and innovate.

I used to be graphics designer and user-interface designer before taking developer path. This perhaps gives me some advantage as front-end developer.

##### Concept Designer (EKS / Voimaradio Oy) 
Jan 2008 - Jan 2009

I was invited to help build DJ hardware product for a Finnish electronics company. They had DJ controller which controlled their own DJ software. As being music professional they approached me and asked for my opinion of the product. I could point several things about their product why it wasn't suitable for pro users, so they asked if I could help them create better version of it.

The product was called "Otus" and I was involved with philosophy of the product (how to make it future proof), core concept and features, user-interface and software integration. There was UI design collaboration with Komia Design from Jyväskylä who designed the case for the device. My role was to think where to place the controls and what controls are needed to make it attractive for pro DJ's.

Also I was involved in designing something we called "Visual MIDI driver". Usually hardware products need to contact DJ software makers and ask them to support their controller but we were able to turn this around by making a system where we could support any hardware without even asking them for help. I used this driver then to build support for all the major DJ softwares, which was key sales point of the product as well.
